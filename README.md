Guide to start examples

- Run ./init.sh to install node modules for all packages
- Cd to packages/modules/product-list and run npm run start:prod
- Cd to packages/modules/product-detail and run npm run start:prod
- Cd to packages/applications/my-site and run npm run start:dev

Note that:
Because project is strucuted by following multi-packages in one repo approach, so to avoid lint issues from editor extension/intelligence, you should open `research-micro-frontend.code-workspace` to work.
